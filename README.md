## Summary

Music Match is a game where the player, after signing in to their account, chooses a category of music.  The player will then be played a sample of a song in the chosen genre and given a list of four possible answers, Artist name and track name.  The player has to choose which answer matches the song playing.  The faster the player answers, the more points they will earn!  After four songs, the round is complete, their score is tallied up and they are taken back to the genre selection menu.  Players accrue experience matching the points scored and have a level based on how much total experience they have earned.  This is the online version of Music Match, Music Match was created with the same framework as apps like Slack and Atom, so it is a downloaded application that runs independently from the users browser.  It does however connect to a server for sign up/in and stat tracking capabilities.

## Next Steps

1. Refactor to use AngularJS or React instead of jQuery.
1. Add more animations and improve existing ones.
1. Create a leaderboard for the fastest answers on each song.
1. Create a multiplayer option, where users will compete in real time against each other.
1. Allow users to connect to iTunes directly from the scoreboard screen to purchase songs that were played.
1. Create routes in the server to allow modifications to the genre song lists without requiring a user redownload an updated version of the application.
